defprotocol Zip do
  @moduledoc """
  The Zip interface allows all sorts of operations on collections. If you squint you might see an
  applicative.

  The collections need to have some sort of order for this interface to return stable results, so
  a good example is a list. The zip interface allows us, for example, to add elements from two lists
  together pairwise. What does pairwise mean? You take the first element in the first list, and the
  first element in the second list and add them together. Then the second elements in each list get
  added together and so on.

  ### Example

      iex> Zip.apply([1, 2], [1, 2], %Add{})
      [2, 4]
  """
  def apply(collection_1, collection_2, operation)
